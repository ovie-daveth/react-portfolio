  },
  {
    question: "How do you handle revisions and feedback?",
    answer: "Depending on the package you choose, I offer 1 to unlimited rounds of revisions. Revisions ensure that the final product meets your expectations, and you can always share your feedback during our scheduled review sessions."
  },
  {
    question: "What is your availability and typical turnaround time?",
    answer: "For the Basic package, Iâ€™m available for up to 10 hours a week, with a turnaround time of 2-4 weeks. For Standard and Premium packages, I can dedicate more hours and offer quicker turnarounds, typically within 1-2 weeks or faster for urgent projects."
  },
  {
    question: "How do payments and billing work?",

  },
  {
    question: "What tools do you use to manage projects?",
    answer: "I use email for communication in the Basic package. For Standard and Premium packages, I integrate tools like Trello, Jira, and Slack for better collaboration, progress tracking, and live updates. This helps keep the project on track and ensures transparency."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I upgrade my package during the project?",
    answer: "Absolutely! If your project grows in scope or you need additional support, you can upgrade your package at any time. We can adjust the pricing and timeline accordingly to fit your evolving needs."
